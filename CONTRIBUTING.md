## Developing Genetic Forensic Portal

Genetic Forensic Portal is in its initial phase of development. Follow the below
steps for setting up the development environment and contributing to the
project.

### Environment Setup

Fork the repository, and create your local version, then follow the installation
steps:

1. Create conda environment

```bash
conda create -y -n genetic-forensics python=3.12 pip
```

2. Activate conda environment

```bash
conda activate genetic-forensics
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

### Post setup

You should prepare pre-commit, which will help you run the linting and
formatting checks configured in the project before every commit.

```bash
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

NOTE: You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or
`pre-commit run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

## Run Genetic Forensic portal

You are now ready to run the Genetic Forensic portal Streamlit application:
