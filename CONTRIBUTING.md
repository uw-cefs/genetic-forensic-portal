# Welcome to Genetic Forensic Portal contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/uw-ssec/code-of-conduct/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Developing Genetic Forensic Portal

Genetic Forensic Portal is in its initial phase of development. Follow the below
steps for setting up the development environment and contributing to the
project.

### Environment Setup

Fork the repository, and create your local version, then follow the installation
steps:

1. Create conda environment

   ```bash
   conda create -y -n genetic-forensics python=3.12 pip
   ```

2. Activate conda environment

   ```bash
   conda activate genetic-forensics
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[all]"
   ```

### Post setup

You should prepare pre-commit, which will help you run the linting and
formatting checks configured in the project before every commit.

```bash
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

NOTE: You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or
`pre-commit run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

## Run Genetic Forensic portal

First run the authentication application (Keycloak server) with the following
command

```bash
gf-auth-run
```

You are now ready to run the Genetic Forensic portal Streamlit application:

```bash
gf-portal
```

## Stopping the auth portal

To stop the auth portal, run the following command:

```bash
gf-auth-stop
```

## DO NOT RUN IN PROD: Exporting a list of DEV users from the DEV auth server

To update the Keycloak realm containing the dev users, you can run the following
command. Do not export your actual production users this way, as you do NOT want
those users being uploaded to the repository.

```bash
gf-auth-dev-export-DO-NOT-RUN-IN-PROD
```

## Testing

When making changes, please run the following tests:

Unit tests:

```bash
pytest ./tests
```

Unit tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=genetic_forensic_portal tests/ --cov-report xml:coverage.xml
```

## Developing with nox

The fastest way to start with development is to use nox. If you don't have nox,
you can use `pipx run nox` to run it without installing, or `pipx install nox`.
If you don't have pipx (pip for applications), then you can install with
`pip install pipx` (the only case were installing an application with regular
pip is reasonable). If you use macOS, then pipx and nox are both in brew, use
`brew install pipx nox`.

To use, run `nox`. This will lint and test using every installed version of
Python on your system, skipping ones that are not installed. You can also run
specific jobs:

```console
$ nox -s lint  # Lint only
$ nox -s tests  # Python tests
$ nox -s build_api_docs # Build the API docs from docstrings
$ nox -s docs -- --serve  # Build and serve the docs
$ nox -s build  # Make an SDist and wheel
```

Nox handles everything for you, including setting up an temporary virtual
environment for each run.

## Building docs

Build the API docs using the command below. This will generate the API
documentation, which are retrieved from the docstrings in the code.:

```bash
nox -s build_api_docs
```

You can see a preview with:

```bash
nox -s docs -- --serve
```

You can build the docs to html using:

```bash
nox -s docs
```

## Pull Requests

Please follow the below guidelines when you want to raise a Pull Request:

- It may be helpful to review
  [this tutorial](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/) on how
  to contribute to open source projects. A typical task workflow is:

  - [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the
    code repository specified in the task and
    [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    it locally.
  - Review the repo's README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files to understand what is
    required to run and modify this code.
  - Create a branch in your local repo to implement the task.
  - Commit your changes to the branch and push it to the remote repo.
  - Create a pull request, adding the task owner as the reviewer.

- Please follow the
  [Conventional Commits](https://github.com/uw-ssec/rse-guidelines/blob/main/conventional-commits.md)
  naming for pull request titles.
