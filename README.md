Poaching remains a critical threat to biodiversity worldwide, driving numerous
species to the brink of extinction. University of Washington’s
[Center for Environmental Forensic Science (CEFS)](https://cefs.uw.edu/) has a
history of pioneering forensic techniques to tackle this crisis. Among its
notable contributions are advancements in genetic forensics, which have
revolutionized the field of wildlife crime investigation.

Central to CEFS’s approach is the application of genetic analysis to identify
and track illicit wildlife products. By extracting DNA from confiscated
specimens, researchers can determine the species, origin, and in certain cases,
individual identity of the animals involved. This innovative technique has
proven instrumental in linking poached products to their source populations and
facilitating law enforcement efforts.

Building upon CEFS’s tradition of innovation, SSEC is developing a secure online
portal which will enable national labs in Africa and SE Asia to submit genotypes
acquired from seized ivory for rapid analysis. This collaborative effort brings
together expertise in software engineering and wildlife forensics to create a
powerful tool which allows for the uploading, analysis, and visualization of
genetic data from poached specimens.
